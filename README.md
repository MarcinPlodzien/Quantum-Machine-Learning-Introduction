# Introduction to Hybrid Quantum-Classical Machine Learning methods in Quantum Computing

This repository contains lectures I gave during the
"VI Pyrenees Winter School Quantum Information Meeting for Barcelona's Community" (Setcases, Spain, 14-17.02.2023).

Outline:
1. Introduction to Automatic Differentiation
2. Implementing quantum gates from scratch: Simulating circuits and qubit gates
3. Example: Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) implementation from scratch with PyTorch
4. Example: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) implementation from scratch with PyTorch
